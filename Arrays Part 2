An array with one element is also known as a 1x1 array or scalar.
Vectors are when you only have one row or one column of elements.
Matrices are described by the number of colums and rows they have. 
An important thing to keep in mind when concatenating arrays is when you're creating the 
array within the boxed brackets to list them in a consistent fashion.

Example code:
>> scalar = [ 5 ]

scalar =

     5

>> rowVec = [ 1 3 5 ]

rowVec =

     1     3     5

>> colVec = [ 1 ; 3 ; 5 ]

colVec =

     1
     3
     5

>> mat = [ 4 5 6 ; 1 2 3 ; 7 8 9 ]

mat =

     4     5     6
     1     2     3
     7     8     9

>> rec = [ 0 2 4 ; 6 7 8 ]

rec =

     0     2     4
     6     7     8

>> colVec =
 colVec =
         â†‘
Error: Invalid expression. Check for missing or extra characters.
 
>> colVec = [ 1 ; 3 ; 5 ]

colVec =

     1
     3
     5

>> concat = [ colVec ; scalar ]

concat =

     1
     3
     5
     5

>> err = [ colVec , scalar ]
Error using horzcat
Dimensions of arrays being concatenated are not consistent.
 
>> array = [ colVec , mat ]

array =

     1     4     5     6
     3     1     2     3
     5     7     8     9

Reviewed the basic components of a speaker which is an electromagnetic device that takes an electric signal and converts it 
into sound waves via electromagnetic mechanics of the speaker driver and cone replicating the analogous signal that was converted via DAC.
