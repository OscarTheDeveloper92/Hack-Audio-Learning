Using the built in audioinfo function in MatLab we can recover diferent types of information of our audio file.

The basic syntax of this function is info = audioinfo(filename)
The different output variables are: info.Filename (basic string text of the name of our file), info.CompressionMethod (whether it's compressed or not), info.NumChannels (1 or 2, regarding mono/stereo), 
info.TotalSamples (total number of samples), info.Duration (how long our file is), info.BitsPerSample (bit depth of our audio file).

Sample Code:
>> audioinfo('Vocal.wav')

ans = 

  struct with fields:

             Filename: '/MATLAB Drive/Vocal.wav'
    CompressionMethod: 'Uncompressed'
          NumChannels: 1
           SampleRate: 44100
         TotalSamples: 215444
             Duration: 4.8854

>> signalInfo = audioinfo('Vocal.wav')

signalInfo = 

  struct with fields:

    CompressionMethod: 'Uncompressed'
          NumChannels: 1
           SampleRate: 44100
         TotalSamples: 215444
