Upon trying to input an audio file into MatLab I encountered a common error and noticed that my command window
prompt wasn't taking in any more user inputs. After a quick google search I found out that the program was
'busy' and awaited a user input. In order to interupt the program and resume programming I pressed Ctrl+C.

After fixing my issue with importing an audio file I was able to properly input the file in MatLab and assign the audio file
with 2 seperate variable names (Fs, and y) as well as use the audioread command. For my variables Fs and y, Fs 
was the sample rate of my audio signal and y is the elements in the sample array which I also plotted. When I displayed 
the plot, I was able to see the sine wave of my audio signal on an amplitude vs samples graph.
