Upon trying to input an audio file into MatLab I encountered a common error and noticed that my command window
prompt wasn't taking in any more user inputs. After a quick google search I found out that the program was
'busy' and awaited a user input. In order to interrupt the program and resume programming I pressed Ctrl+C.

After fixing my issue with importing an audio file I was able to properly input the file in MatLab and assign the audio file
with 2 seperate variable names (Fs, and y) as well as use the audioread command. For my variables Fs and y, Fs 
was the sample rate of my audio signal and y is the elements in the sample array which I also plotted. When I displayed 
the plot, I was able to see the sine wave of my audio signal on an amplitude vs samples graph.

AudioRead Function Review:
The [var1, var2] = audioread('audiofile.wav') function allows you to import the samples of a digital audio file and output the sample rate, and an array of samples.
The first variable within the brackets of the function is assigned to the sample rate and the second variable is the 
array of samples.

Side Tangent: I then curated a playlist to get an overview behind the math of audio bit depth. 
The videos covered the topics of: Binary Numbers, Logarithms and Decibels, Intro to Quantization, and Sound Intensity and decibel scale.
