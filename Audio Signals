An audio signal is the disturbance of air molecules which oscillate back and forth which forms a travelling wave of information from a mechanical source.
For example the vibrations of a guitar string create air waves which has information within the wave that travels through space. This does not mean that the air from the initial sources with the audio signal travels to your ear.
What it simply means is that the air ripples, and the air wave that is carrying the audio signal bumps into neighboring air molecules in sequence which eventually lead up to the air molecules next to your ear.
