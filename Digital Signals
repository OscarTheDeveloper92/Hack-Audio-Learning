In order to convert analog audio signals into a digital form you have to take 'samples' of the signal.
These digital signals are a representation of the amplitude of the signal with respect to time in a process 
called pulse code modulation (PCM). The amount of amplitude measurements is known as the sample rate, common
sample rates are 44,100 samples per second (CD) and 48,000 samples per second (DVD). In MatLab these audio samples
can be stored as elements in an array. In a graph an analog signal can appear as a sine wave while a 
digitized signal can be represented as a lolipop graph which is a sampled representation of the analog signal
within an amplitude vs time graph.
