Variables: Variables are a set of characters in which you assign them values and can be re-used throughout your programs. Also the MATLAB workspace allows you to view your variables that you have created and stored in memory.

Had a true day off and had fun with friends.

Finished watching the variables video of the module and also learned about the uses of the '=' sign which isn't necessarily that something is equal to something. It's used for assigning functions to variables. I also learned about the semi-colon ';' and how it's used to suppress the output after decalaring variables.

Variable Types
Different types of data is stored and labeled differently in computer programming. The two main types are numerical and text-based information. 
Strings: With strings, you can create a collection of characters and assign them to a variable. The string data type is written by declaring your variable followed by the assignment operator, single quotes, and then your text. For example x = 'Hot Dogs.', notice how I can also add spaces and punctuation marks.
