Variables: Variables are a set of characters in which you assign them values and can be re-used throughout your programs. Also the MATLAB workspace allows you to view your variables that you have created and stored in memory.

Had a true day off and had fun with friends.

Finished watching the variables video of the module and also learned about the uses of the '=' sign which isn't necessarily that something is equal to something. It's used for assigning functions to variables. I also learned about the semi-colon ';' and how it's used to suppress the output after decalaring variables.

Variable Types
Different types of data is stored and labeled differently in computer programming. The two main types are numerical and text-based information. 

Strings: With strings, you can create a collection of characters and assign them to a variable. The string data type is written by declaring your variable followed by the assignment operator, single quotes, and then your text. For example x = 'Hot Dogs.', notice how I can also add spaces and punctuation marks.

Another thing about strings is that they don't have to strictly be text. Strings can also be numbers. 
To concatenate (adhere characters together) for example in order to print out 'abc' as a string of text, you can call the function con = ['char', 'char', 'char'] this will display the inputted characters between the brackets as a single thread of text.

Another cool thing I learned is how to stack strings together in columns. In order to do this we create a variable and assign it to it's separate strings in a brack it, but separate them by using semi-colons instead of commas like so: column = [str1 ; 'World']. Understanding how to format things both vertically and horizontally is going to be a vital skill when it comes to formatting audio signals in arrays, and matrices.
