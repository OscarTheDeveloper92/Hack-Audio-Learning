Math Operators: 

Basic mathematical computations can be used with the basic operators of +,-,*, and /. The computer then executes the expression using the order of operations, 'PEMDAS'. PEMDAS stands for Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

Math functions can easily be executed in MATLAB using certain commands. For example sqrt(9) uses the square root function. To find the absolute value and always render a positive number is abs(x). A logarithm of any desired base could be logx(x) where x is our desired value. I also learned that you can round decimal values by simple typing round(x), the way it rounds is synonymous to how it's taught in primary school.
