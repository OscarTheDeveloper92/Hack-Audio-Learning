Previously with the audioread() function we were able to assign variables to both the array of audio sample elements
and the proper sample rate of an audio file.

With the sound() function we can take those variables initially stored within the audioread function and play the audio 
file through out device's sound system. Below is sample code of this execution.

>> [y, Fs] = audioread('Vocal.wav');
>> sound(y,Fs);
>> sound(y);
>> clear sound

In line 7 you can see the previously covered function of audioread() which assigns the variables y and Fs 
in the brackets to the sample elements in the array and the sample rate of the information within the audiofile.
Line 8 calls upon the sound function with the variables of y and Fs so that MatLab plays the proper stored 
information in the audio file as sound.
Line 9 shows us what happens if we only play one component of the audio file and we get an undesired sound playback, 
and finally the clear sound command allows us to stop the audio playback.
